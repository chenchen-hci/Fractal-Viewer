# Android-Fractal-Viewer
Simple Android app generating a magnifiable fractal image using mathematical set.
The app has paseed the test on Nexus S API 21 (Google APIs ARM (armeabi-v7a)).

## Credits

First Android project as well as mini-project of Web Based Computing (H63JAV) provided by the [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Nottingham](http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/engineering/Departments/EEE/index.aspxhttp://www.nottingham.ac.uk/engineering/Departments/EEE/index.aspx).

Huge thanks to all course staffs, especially [Dr. Kristof Cools](http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/engineering/departments/eee/people/kristof.cools) for the project frame work as well as guidence and hints.

## Introduction

A fractal image, which can be generated by mathematical set, is able to be zoomed in/out at every scale. A more completed introduction on fractal image may be referred to [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal).

The mission of this min-project is to build simple Android app capable of zooming in/out, reset, share generated fractal image using mathematical alggoithms as follows [1]:

```java
void update(){
    for(int i = 0; i < w; ++i){
        for(int j = 0; j < h; ++j){
            double x = x0 + i/(double)w * (x1 - x0);
            double y = y0 + (h - j) / (double)h * (y1 - y0);
            double zx = 0;
            double zy = 0;
            int iter = 512;
            while(zx * zx + zy * zy < 4 && iter > 0){
               double zx_new = zx * zx - zy * zy + x;
               double zy_new = 2 * zx * zy + y;
                 zx = zx_new;
                 zy = zy_new;
                   --iter;
            }
            image.setPixel(i, j, iter | (iter << 8) | (iter << 16));
        }
    }
  }
``` 

## Example Outputs

The following tests are implemented on Nexus S API 21, unpredictable exceptions may occur if other version of Android devices are used.

### Example output of initialized view

### Example output of zoomed view

Note: the image can be zoomed at every scale.

### Example output of share feature

Note: the zoomed image can be shared as a source of different app, e.g. text message, facebook etc. by registrating the app as the source of intent-filter.
